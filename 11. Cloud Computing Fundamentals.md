## The Cloud Computing Model
### Cloud Computing Definition
NIST defines cloud computing as:

> A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

This definition highlights five essential characteristics that make a service 'cloud':
1. **On-demand self-service**: users can automatically provision IT resources such as storage or computing as needed, without human intervention
2. **Broad Network Access**: resources are available over the network with accessibility available for multiple devices including smartphones, laptops, and tablets, providing flexibility and convenience for consumers 
3. **Resource Pooling**: physical IT devices such as storage and computing power are pooled together to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model; despite sharing physical devices consumers perceive the infrastructure as their own separate pool, isolated from other users' information
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: cloud resources can be quickly added and removed, matching changing demands; this flexibility creates the illusion of infinite capacity for the user, however the cloud provider often sets usage quotas to prevent users from exceeding available resources
5. **Measured Service**: resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer; also creates a business model which allows the cloud user to pay only for the resources used

### Cloud Service Models
IT resources (computing, storage, databases) deployed in the cloud are known as "services" since they are managed by the cloud provider.

NIST distinguishes these services between three models:
1. **SaaS**: software as a service, customers can start using everything without worrying about maintenance (ex. Gmail, Dropbox, etc.)
2. **PaaS**: platform as a service, customers are able to use the platform to build more personalized solutions (ex. Azure, Salesforce, etc.)
3. **IaaS**: infrastructure as a service, customers are provided with servers and storage to build their own IT environments (ex. AWS, Linode, etc.)

### Cloud Deployment Models
Cloud providers set up physical infrastructure, including computing, networking, and storage devices to offer cloud services to customers. Orgs can then use these cloud services from an external cloud provider that offer cloud services publicly, or they may set up internal infrastructure to consume cloud services privately.

NIST categorizes deployment strategies into four deployment models:
1. **Public**: owned and managed by third-party providers, offering cloud services resources over the internet, usually pay-as-you-go model; enable orgs to start consuming cloud services immediately (ex. AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. **Private**: dedicated to a single org, with infra typically located on the org's premises; the org serves as both the cloud user and cloud provider, ideal for orgs that need to host their data on-prem or have existing infra and want to offer it internally between business areas
3. **Community**: not typical, can be treated as a special case of a private cloud where cloud services are provided to more than one org (usually in a multi-tenant model)
4. **Hybrid**: blend of public and private, allowing data and applications to move between them; used by orgs that want to draw from the benefits of both models

### Cloud Native Applications
Cloud-native apps are designed specifically to take advantage of cloud computing *microservices*. Microservices are modular components that execute a single task of the overall application. This allows us to split up the platform into smaller, independent services, each handling a specific function (e.g. one for managing user accounts, one for handling a product catalog, another for orders, etc.)

Cloud-native apps are designed this way so that if more capacity is needed to handle increased load, additional copies of the overwhelmed microservice can be added. This process is known as *scaling* and is typically automated by the cloud management solution. Cloud-native apps rely on efficient scaling and building them from scratch can be a challenging task. 

The *Cloud Native Computing Foundation* (CNCF) plays a crucial role in promoting cloud-native practices. It provides support for developing and managing cloud-native apps through open-source projects. CNCF fosters an ecosystem of tools and frameworks to automate, scale, and orchestrate microservices.

### Public Cloud Providers 
The physical infrastructure installed by cloud providers to deliver services is called a *data center* and it includes a vast quantity of equipment including power supplies, cooling systems, networking, computing, and storage. 

A key term when considering public cloud providers is the *Shared Responsibility Model*. This concept generally outlines that managing security and proper functioning of cloud services is a joint effort between the cloud provider and the consumer. The cloud provider is generally responsible for the physical infrastructure, while the consumer manages the cloud resources they deploy and their configuration.

A lot of cloud vulnerabilities are often introduced via misconfigurations by the cloud consumer, sometimes caused by the assumption that it will already be secured by the cloud provider.

### Cloud Adoption Considerations
Adopting cloud computing requires a significant paradigm shift in IT management, transitioning from traditional on-prem infrastructure to a model that prioritizes flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in IT provisioning

From an org and business perspective, shifting to a public cloud model means moving away from significant upfront investments toward a predictable, pay-as-you-go pricing structure for cloud services. Typically, the overall cost of a public cloud is higher than hosting infra on-prem. However, it requires significantly less capital expenditure, allowing orgs to launch services faster and often on more reliable infra. Moving to private cloud requires a substantial investment in hardware, software, and specialized employees.

From a technical perspective, this shift requires adopting new knowledge and processes for IT provisioning. It means learning how to efficiently manage cloud resources, implement security measures, and optimize costs. Adopting cloud-native app architecture is also crucial for fully harnessing the benefits of cloud computing.

From a cybersecurity perspective, orgs need to consider risks associated with cloud computing techniques, then plan and implement controls to mitigate those risks.

It's also essential to consider regulatory or industry compliance requirements (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI). These laws typically specify the requirements for physical location where data is processed and stored.
