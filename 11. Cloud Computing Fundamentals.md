## The Cloud Computing Model
### Cloud Computing Definition
NIST defines cloud computing as:

> A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

This definition highlights five essential characteristics that make a service 'cloud':
1. **On-demand self-service**: users can automatically provision IT resources such as storage or computing as needed, without human intervention
2. **Broad Network Access**: resources are available over the network with accessibility available for multiple devices including smartphones, laptops, and tablets, providing flexibility and convenience for consumers 
3. **Resource Pooling**: physical IT devices such as storage and computing power are pooled together to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model; despite sharing physical devices consumers perceive the infrastructure as their own separate pool, isolated from other users' information
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: cloud resources can be quickly added and removed, matching changing demands; this flexibility creates the illusion of infinite capacity for the user, however the cloud provider often sets usage quotas to prevent users from exceeding available resources
5. **Measured Service**: resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer; also creates a business model which allows the cloud user to pay only for the resources used

### Cloud Service Models
IT resources (computing, storage, databases) deployed in the cloud are known as "services" since they are managed by the cloud provider.

NIST distinguishes these services between three models:
1. **SaaS**: software as a service, customers can start using everything without worrying about maintenance (ex. Gmail, Dropbox, etc.)
2. **PaaS**: platform as a service, customers are able to use the platform to build more personalized solutions (ex. Azure, Salesforce, etc.)
3. **IaaS**: infrastructure as a service, customers are provided with servers and storage to build their own IT environments (ex. AWS, Linode, etc.)

### Cloud Deployment Models
Cloud providers set up physical infrastructure, including computing, networking, and storage devices to offer cloud services to customers. Orgs can then use these cloud services from an external cloud provider that offer cloud services publicly, or they may set up internal infrastructure to consume cloud services privately.

NIST categorizes deployment strategies into four deployment models:
1. **Public**: owned and managed by third-party providers, offering cloud services resources over the internet, usually pay-as-you-go model; enable orgs to start consuming cloud services immediately (ex. AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. **Private**: dedicated to a single org, with infra typically located on the org's premises; the org serves as both the cloud user and cloud provider, ideal for orgs that need to host their data on-prem or have existing infra and want to offer it internally between business areas
3. **Community**: not typical, can be treated as a special case of a private cloud where cloud services are provided to more than one org (usually in a multi-tenant model)
4. **Hybrid**: blend of public and private, allowing data and applications to move between them; used by orgs that want to draw from the benefits of both models
