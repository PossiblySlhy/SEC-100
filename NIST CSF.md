[Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

A collection of standards and practices designed to help organizations understand and reduce cybersecurity risk.

Originally developed to help protect critical infrastructure. A wide array of orgs have subsequently adopted it.

## Components
### Core
A set of cybersecurity activities and outcomes, divided into six high-level functions:

1. ==**Govern**==
2. ==**Identify** (ID)==
3. ==**Protect** (PR)==
4. ==**Detect** (DE)==
5. ==**Respond** (RS)==
6. ==**Recover** (RC)==

Each function encompasses a number of categories. For example, the *Identify* function consists of the three categories of *Asset Management (ID.AM)*, *Risk Assessment (ID.RA)*, and *Improvement (ID.IM)*

These categories include subcategories that consist of statements describing the outcome of improved security. *ID.RA* for example contains 10 subcategories *ID.RA.1* (vulnerabilities in assets are identified, validated, and recorded) through *ID.RA.10* (critical suppliers are assessed prior to acquisition).

## Framework Implementation Tiers
The Framework Implementation Tiers specify the degree to which an org's cybersecurity practices satisfy the outcome described by the subcats of the Core.

There are 4 such tiers: ==*partial*== (being the lowest), ==*risk-informed*==, ==*repeatable*==, and ==*adaptive*==.

## Framework Profiles
Framework Profiles refer to the relationship between the present implementation of an org's cybersecurity activities (==*Current Profile*==) and their desired outcome (==*Target Profile*==)
