## Introduction to PowerShell
- Object-Oriented Scripting language
- Hybrid shell, command and scripting
    - For every command, it returns a .NET object

PowerShell 5.1 is native to Windows (usually included with Windows installations), PowerShell 7 is cross-platform, open-source, but has to be manually installed
- 5.1 uses the powershell.exe binary, 7 uses pwsh.exe
- Various compatibility issues between 5.1 and 7
    - Maintained at different rates and different levels of support
    - Some commands are version-dependent

In summary, check the version of PowerShell before executing commands and keep backwards compatibility in mind before deploying scripts in production environments

## Powershell Building Blocks
### Cmdlets
- Commands that we can run from a PowerShell shell
- Slightly different from typical commands
    - Commands are programs compiled into an executable file and can run on its own, often using a .exe file extension in Windows
    - Cmdlets are not executable files, rather .NET code or PowerShell code
        - Usually a verb-noun (i.e. `Get-Help`, provides information about cmdlets, similar to `man` in Linux)

### Variables and Expressions
- An expression is a piece of code that does something
- All variables start with `$`
    - Can perform arithmetic with variables
    - Clear variables with `Clear-Variable -Name $[variablename]`

### Data Types and Objects
Just like other programming languages, all variables have a type
- Get variable type with `$variable.GetType()`
- Cast as a type with `[Int]$variable`
    - `Int` is `Int32`, can also use `Int64` for larger numbers

### Properties and Methods
All objects have *properties* and *methods*
- Property is a characteristic of an object
    - Read or Write only
    - For example, Strings have a length `$variable.Length` returns the length of the string
- Method is an action that can be executed on an object (i.e. `GetType()` shown previously)
    - Another example, `$variable.Contains()` when used on a string can be used to test if the string contains the specified text
- Can use `Get-Member -InputObject $variable` to view all properties and methods for an object

### Comparisons
Unlike other programming languages, PowerShell does not use mathematical symbols for comparisons. Instead, it uses *comparison operators*, which start with a - character

| **Operator Type** | **Operator** | **Definition**                            |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Equality          | -eq          | Equal                                     |
| Equality          | -ne          | Not Equal                                 |
| Equality          | -gt          | Greater than                              |
| Equality          | -ge          | Greater than or Equal to                  |
| Equality          | -lt          | Less than                                 |
| Equality          | -le          | Less than or Equal to                     |
| Matching          | -like        | compares strings using regular expression |
| Matching          | -notlike     | compares strings using regular expression |
| Matching          | -match       | compares strings using regular expression |
| Matching          | -notmatch    | compares strings using regular expression |
| Containment       | -contains    | searches value to see if it exists or not |
| Containment       | -in          | searches value to see if it exists or not |
| Containment       | -notcontains | searches value to see if it exists or not |
| Containment       | -notin       | searches value to see if it exists or not |
| Replacement       | -replace     | replaces part or all of the value         |
| Comparison        | -is          | compares data types (not values)          |
| Comparison        | -isnot       | compares data types (not values)          |

We can also use if/else statements in PowerShell
```pwsh
if ($mygrade -ge 70)
{
    Write-Output "Passed"
}
else
{
    Write-Output "Failed"
}
```

### Loops
Loops in PowerShell are generally very similar to other programming languages
```pwsh
# for loop
for ($var = 0; $var -lt 5; $var++)
{
    Write-Output $var
}

# foreach loop
$word = "powershell"
$array = $word.ToCharArray()

foreach ($letter in $array)
{
    $letter
}

#while loop
$count = 0
while ($count -lt 5)
{
    Write-Output $count
    $count++
}
```
- `continue` in a loop can be used to return to the start of a loop
- `break` also works in PowerShell

## Writing and Running PowerShell Scripts
### Execution Policy
Powershell limits what kinds of scripts it will run based on the execution policy
- Default policy is set to Restricted for clients, RemoteSigned for servers
- Use `Get-ExecutionPolicy` to determine the current policy
- Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy` to set the policy
    - ex: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -exec RemoteSigned -Scope Process`

### Modules
You can write a script and import it as a module in other scripts, effectively taking the function and using it within another script
1. Define a function within a script
2. Save the script as .ps1
3. In PowerShell ISE, simply type the name of the file containing the function you want to use and it will autofill
4. In a PowerShell terminal, use `Import-Module [path\to\.ps1]` then call the function
