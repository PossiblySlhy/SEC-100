## Introduction to PowerShell
- Object-Oriented Scripting language
- Hybrid shell, command and scripting
    - For every command, it returns a .NET object

PowerShell 5.1 is native to Windows (usually included with Windows installations), PowerShell 7 is cross-platform, open-source, but has to be manually installed
- 5.1 uses the powershell.exe binary, 7 uses pwsh.exe
- Various compatibility issues between 5.1 and 7
    - Maintained at different rates and different levels of support
    - Some commands are version-dependent

In summary, check the version of PowerShell before executing commands and keep backwards compatibility in mind before deploying scripts in production environments

## Powershell Building Blocks
### Cmdlets
- Commands that we can run from a PowerShell shell
- Slightly different from typical commands
    - Commands are programs compiled into an executable file and can run on its own, often using a .exe file extension in Windows
    - Cmdlets are not executable files, rather .NET code or PowerShell code
        - Usually a verb-noun (i.e. `Get-Help`, provides information about cmdlets, similar to `man` in Linux)

### Variables and Expressions
- An expression is a piece of code that does something
- All variables start with `$`
