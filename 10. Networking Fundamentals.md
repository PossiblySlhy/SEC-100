## The OSI Model

A _network model_ is a conceptual framework

- helps us understand how we could organize communication between devices
- helps give a high-level understanding of what devices do across networks
  - in practice, implementations are not clearly defined
- once we understand network models, we can implement**network protocols** which describe how two or more entities should communicate in practice
- PDU is the unit of information that is transmitted at a certain layer
- Each layer depends on the information provided by the layer immediately below it, referred to as**encapsulation**

### OSI Model Details

Made up of 7 layers (**P**eople **D**on't **N**eed **T**hose **S**tupid **P**ackets **A**nyways)

1. Physical Layer (**P**eople)
   - Raw data between physical devices
   - Transformation of digital bits in to physical bits (i.e. electricity, radio waves, photons)
   - More electrical engineering oriented
   - PDU: Bits
2. Data Link layer (**D**on't)
   - Transferring data between hosts physically connected to the same network
   - Protocols on layer 2 define rules for initiating, monitoring, and terminating communication between physically connected machines
   - Performs error detection/correction for issues on the layer below it
   - 2 sub-layers
     - MAC: determines how and when different devices are allowed to communicate with each other
     - LLC (_Logical Link Control_): provides flow control and error handling functions
   - PDU: Frame
3. Network Layer (**N**eed)
   - Primarily concerned with information travelling between 2+ different networks
   - Some functions include routing and broadcasting of messages and the addressing of multiple hosts
   - PDU: Packets
4. Transport Layer (**T**hose)
   - Largely (not solely) responsible for ensuring data gets from host to host in order and on time
   - Handles errors to ensure that any hosts involved are aware of any data that needs to be resent
   - Alerts the sending host(s) if they are sending data across the network too quickly
   - PDU: for connection-oriented (statful) Segments are used, for connection-less (stateless) Datagrams are used
5. Session Layer (**S**tupid)
   - Implements protocols for initiating, maintaining, and eventually terminating multiple different connections between hosts
   - Ongoing connections are often called sessions
   - PDU: Data
6. Presentation (**P**ackets)
   - Responsible for taking data it receives from the layer below (Session) and rearranging it so the Application layer can present it to the user
   - Involves encrypting, compressing, or otherwise transforming data
   - PDU: Data
7. Application (**A**nyway)
   - Defines how a human or software can interact with a network
   - Does not refer to programs or applications, rather refers to how the softare receives the data
     - ex: browsing the web and downloading emails are facilitated by the Application layer
   - PDU: Data

In summary, the **Physical Layer** defines how physical transmission should work via electricity, radio waves, or light. Next, the **Data Link Layer** defines how digital information should travel across physically connected hosts. Third, the **Network Layer** expresses how that information should continue across to other networks. Fourth, the **Transport Layer** performs QC and makes sure information arrives on time and in proper order. Fifth, the **Session Layer** is responsible for facilitating connections between devices. Sixth, the **Presentation Layer** transforms the data into an agreeable format. Finally, the **Application Layer** determins how that data should be sent to and from the applications in use.

## TCP/IP Model

- 4 layers out of the 7 in OSI
- More descriptive of modern communication in today's internet
  - still only a model, actual implementation can be more complex
- Compared to OSI, TCP/IP is less concerned with with strict encapsulation
  - primary goal is to scrop or classify communication at 4 different levels so that each level does not need to pay attention to the level below it

1. Link Layer
   - Concerned with what rules should be used to define communication within the same physical network
   - Comparable to OSI Data Link, but also dabbles in functions of the OSI Network Layer
   - Not explicitly defined as an analogy to the OSI Physical Layer, assumes that protocols should be agnostic to the physical instantiation of data
   - Important Protocol(s): **ARP**
2. Internet Layer
   - Concerned with what rules should be used to define how information travels between networks
   - One of the most important in understanding how the Internet is built
   - Analagous to OSI Network Layer and is responsible for IP Addresses
   - Important Protocol(s): **IP**, **IPsec**, and **ICMP**
3. Transport Layer
   - Concerned with what rules should be used to determine how machines should communicate together regardless of what networks they are connected to
   - Similar to the OSI Transport Layer, but includes some functions from the OSI Session Layer (i.e. session termination)
   - Defines which port information should travel to/from
   - Important Protocol(s): **TCP** and **UDP**
4. Application Layer
   - Concerned with what rules should be used to determine how different pieces of software can talk to each other
   - Roughly analagous to the OSI Application, Presentation, and Session Layers
   - Important Protocol(s): **HTTP**, **FTP**, and **SMTP**

## Network Protocols

### Link Layer: Ethernet

Networks containing only physical devices are vulnerable to collisions, caused by more than one device transmitting packets on a network segment at the same time. The main purpose of the link layer is to reduce collisions on a physical network.

- Accomplished via switches
  - Connects  devices on a network by splitting up devices into sub-networks
  - Devices on the network can reach other devices by invoking the other device's MAC address
    - 2^48 = 281+ trillion possible MAC addresses, making MAC addresses virtually unique
    - The first half of a MAC address doubles as an Organizationally Unique Identifier, indicating the manufacturing company

When devices send information to another device on the network, it includes its own MAC address as well as the intended target's MAC address in each frame.

Since computers don't know the MAC address of every other device, it leads into ARP

### Internet Layer: Internet Protocol (IP)
*Internet Layer is used when we want to allow devices to connect across networks*

To create an IP address, we take four octets and concatenate them to form a 32-bit integer, ranging between 1-255.

Since each octet is independent of the other, this allows for 2^32 addresses which is almost 4.3 billion addresses. While that is a lot of available addresses, it's not enough to cover the number of devices on the planet. Potential solutions include **NAT** and **subnet masks**.

**Subnet masks**
- use the same numerical format as IP addresses (usually beginning with 255.x.x.x)
  - only written as such for convenience and legibility
- define what IP addresses are allowed to exist within a given network

### Transport Layer: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
#### TCP
TCP Enables two-way communication by establishing a session between machines, initiated by the *Three Way Handshake*

  1. Machine A sends a packet with a SYN flag to Machine B
  2. Machine B receives, the SYN flag and returns a SYN-ACK flag to Machine A
  3. Machine A receives the SYN-ACK flag and returns an ACK flag to Machine B

These three steps allow machines to know reliably that the other is receiving their messages. The sessions is open and the two machines can now send segments back and forth.

TCP also introduces the concept of *ports*. Where an IP packet requires the sender to specify an IP address, a TCP segment requires the sender to specify a port number between 0 and 65535.

   - Ports 0 - 1023 are considered well known ports and are frequently used
   - Allows machines to open up multiple communication sessions at a time

#### UDP
Some network services don't necessarily need to establish two-way communication. So, instead of establishing a session, a machine transmitting via UDP sends the message and assumes that Machine B received it. UDP also defines 65535 ports. UDP is significantly faster, but gives up the reliability of TCP.

## Data Packets and Analysis
### Traffic, Packet Captures, and Wireshark
When data moves across a network, it is sent/received in units called *packets*, which contain a message and metadata about the message it contains. The transfer and flow of many packets is called *network traffic*. This traffic can be sniffed or captured via *packet capture* tools.

Capturing data from network traffic can be useful, both offensively and defensively. Attackers can use the data to gain unencrypted authentication to a web server, while a defender can use the same tool to detect the an attacker's presence on the network.

Packet capture data can be saved for later, most often using the `.pcap` format, allowing data to be open up and analyzed on a different device or even another operating system using different pcap libraries.

#### Wireshark
Wireshark is the most common packet capturing tool. It can be used to sniff live network traffic and analyze previously generated pcap files.

##### Capture Filters
- allow the user to decide what data they want Wireshark to store
  - ex. if we want to only capture incoming or outgoing data for a specific IP address, we can use the *host* capture filter `host [IP Address]`
- using a capture filter tells Wireshark to include only the data that conforms to the filter's definition, meaning any data that does not fit the filter definition will be lost
- can select from a set of pre-defined capture filters by using Wireshark's default list
  - click Capture (or use `Alt+C`) to open the Capture menu, then click Capture Filters...
    - you can also save your own filters to this list by pressing the `+` button

##### Display Filters
- does not affect what data Wireshark intercepts
- applies a temporary mask on packets that do not fit the defined criteria
- can choose from a predefined list by clicking Analyze (or `Alt+A`), then select Display Filters...
