## The OSI Model
A _network model_ is a conceptual framework
- helps us understand how we could organize communication between devices
- helps give a high-level understanding of what devices do across networks
    - in practice, implemenations are not clearly defined
- once we understand network models, we can implement **network protocols** which describe how two or more entities should communicate in practice

### OSI Model Details
Made up of 7 layers (Please Do Not Throw Soggy Pizza Away)
1. Physical Layer
    - Raw data between physical devices
    - Transformation of digital bits in to physical bits (i.e. electricity, radio waves, photons)
    - More electrical engineering oriented
    - PDU: Bits
2. Data Link layer
    - Transferring data between hosts physically connected to the same network
    - Protocols on layer 2 define rules for initiating, monitoring, and terminating communication between physically connected machines
    - Performs error detection/correction for issues on the layer below it
    - 2 sub-layers
        - MAC: determines how and when different devices are allowed to communicate with each other
        - LLC (_Logical Link Control_): provides flow control and error handling functions
    - PDU: Frame
