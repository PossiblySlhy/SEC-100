## The OSI Model
A _network model_ is a conceptual framework
- helps us understand how we could organize communication between devices
- helps give a high-level understanding of what devices do across networks
    - in practice, implementations are not clearly defined
- once we understand network models, we can implement **network protocols** which describe how two or more entities should communicate in practice
- PDU is the unit of information that is transmitted at a certain layer
- Each layer depends on the information provided by the layer immediately below it, referred to as **encapsulation**

### OSI Model Details
Made up of 7 layers (**P**eople **D**on't **N**eed **T**hose **S**tupid **P**ackets **A**nyways)
1. Physical Layer (**P**eople)
    - Raw data between physical devices
    - Transformation of digital bits in to physical bits (i.e. electricity, radio waves, photons)
    - More electrical engineering oriented
    - PDU: Bits
2. Data Link layer (**D**on't)
    - Transferring data between hosts physically connected to the same network
    - Protocols on layer 2 define rules for initiating, monitoring, and terminating communication between physically connected machines
    - Performs error detection/correction for issues on the layer below it
    - 2 sub-layers
        - MAC: determines how and when different devices are allowed to communicate with each other
        - LLC (_Logical Link Control_): provides flow control and error handling functions
    - PDU: Frame 
3. Network Layer (**N**eed)
    - Primarily concerned with information travelling between 2+ different networks
    - Some functions include routing and broadcasting of messages and the addressing of multiple hosts
    - PDU: Packets
4. Transport Layer (**T**hose)
    - Largely (not solely) responsible for ensuring data gets from host to host in order and on time
    - Handles errors to ensure that any hosts involved are aware of any data that needs to be resent
    - Alerts the sending host(s) if they are sending data across the network too quickly
    - PDU: for connection-oriented (statful) Segments are used, for connection-less (stateless) Datagrams are used
5. Session Layer (**S**tupid)
    - Implements protocols for initiating, maintaining, and eventually terminating multiple different connections between hosts
    - Ongoing connections are often called sessions
    - PDU: Data
6. Presentation (**P**ackets)
    - Responsible for taking data it receives from the layer below (Session) and rearranging it so the Application layer can present it to the user
    - Involves encrypting, compressing, or otherwise transforming data
    - PDU: Data
7. Application (**A**nyway)
    - Defines how a human or software can interact with a network
    - Does not refer to programs or applications, rather refers to how the softare receives the data
        - ex: browsing the web and downloading emails are facilitated by the Application layer
    - PDU: Data

In summary, the **Physical Layer** defines how physical transmission should work via electricity, radio waves, or light. Next, the **Data Link Layer** defines how digital information should travel across physically connected hosts. Third, the **Network Layer** expresses how that information should continue across to other networks. Fourth, the **Transport Layer** performs QC and makes sure information arrives on time and in proper order. Fifth, the **Session Layer** is responsible for facilitating connections between devices. Sixth, the **Presentation Layer** transforms the data into an agreeable format. Finally, the **Application Layer** determins how that data should be sent to and from the applications in use.

## TCP/IP Model
- 4 layers out of the 7 in OSI
- More descriptive of modern communication in today's internet
    - still only a model, actual implementation can be more complex
- Compared to OSI, TCP/IP is less concerned with with strict encapsulation
    - primary goal is to scrop or classify communication at 4 different levels so that each level does not need to pay attention to the level below it
<br/><br/>
1. Link Layer
    - Concerned with what rules should be used to define communication within the same physical network
    - Comparable to OSI Data Link, but also dabbles in functions of the OSI Network Layer
    - Not explicitly defined as an analogy to the OSI Physical Layer, assumes that protocols should be agnostic to the physical instantiation of data
    - Important Protocol(s): **ARP**
2. Internet Layer
    - Concerned with what rules should be used to define how information travels between networks
    - One of the most important in understanding how the Internet is built
    - Analagous to OSI Network Layer and is responsible for IP Addresses
    - Important Protocol(s): **IP**, **IPsec**, and **ICMP**
3. Transport Layer
    - Concerned with what rules should be used to determine how machines should communicate together regardless of what networks they are connected to
    - Similar to the OSI Transport Layer, but includes some functions from the OSI Session Layer (i.e. session termination)
    - Defines which port information should travel to/from
    - Important Protocol(s): **TCP** and **UDP**
4. Application Layer
    - Concerned with what rules should be used to determine how different pieces of software can talk to each other
    - Roughly analagous to the OSI Application, Presentation, and Session Layers
    - Important Protocol(s): **HTTP**, **FTP**, and **SMTP**
