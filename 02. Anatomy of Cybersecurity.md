## Learning Goals
1. Mindset of Cybersecurity
2. Cybersecurity Terminology
3. Offensive and Defensive Processes and Capabilities

## 02.1 Mindset of Cybersecurity
"Cybersecurity" means many different things
- #ISO (International Organization for Standards) defines cybersecurity as:
>	The safeguarding of people, society, organizations and nations from cyber risks
- #OffSec defines it more narrowly as:
>	The protection of organizational assets from digital attacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and resources
### CIA Triad
Foundational model that describes the relationship between cybersecurity and its core objectives
- ==Confidentiality==: Can actors without appropriate permissions access the system or information?
- ==Integrity==: Can systems (or data) be modified in some way that is not intended?
- ==Availability==: Are systems (or data) accessible when and how they are intended to be?
### Information Security
Information security is distinguished from other technology disciplines in a few key ways
1. Security involves offensive opponents
	- may be friendly offensive security practitioners or malicious threat actors
		- generally referred to as *attackers*
	- whether simulating an attack or defending against one, we need to consider the perspective and potential actions of an attacker and try to anticipate what they might do
2. Reasoning under uncertainty
	- we can use deductive skills to analyze a situation, but we can't know every possible outcome so we have too apply reasoning to arrive at a solution based on limited facts
	- Metaphor: chess and poker
		- In chess, we can see all of the pieces and so can the opponent. We can make predictions about their next move because we can see all the pieces.
		- In poker, we can't see the opponent's cards
