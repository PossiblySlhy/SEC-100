1. Mindset of Cybersecurity
2. Cybersecurity Terminology
3. Offensive and Defensive Processes and Capabilities

## 2.1 Mindset of Cybersecurity
"Cybersecurity" means many different things
- #ISO (International Organization for Standards) defines cybersecurity as:
>	The safeguarding of people, society, organizations and nations from cyber risks
- #OffSec defines it more narrowly as:
>	The protection of organizational assets from digital attacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and resources
### CIA Triad
Foundational model that describes the relationship between cybersecurity and its core objectives
- ==Confidentiality==: Can actors without appropriate permissions access the system or information?
- ==Integrity==: Can systems (or data) be modified in some way that is not intended?
- ==Availability==: Are systems (or data) accessible when and how they are intended to be?
### Information Security
Information security is distinguished from other technology disciplines in a few key ways
1. Security involves offensive opponents
	- may be friendly offensive security practitioners or malicious threat actors
		- generally referred to as *attackers*
	- whether simulating an attack or defending against one, we need to consider the perspective and potential actions of an attacker and try to anticipate what they might do
2. Reasoning under uncertainty
	- we can use deductive skills to analyze a situation, but we can't know every possible outcome so we have too apply reasoning to arrive at a solution based on limited facts
	- Metaphor: chess and poker
		- In chess, we can see all of the pieces and so can the opponent. We can make predictions about their next move because we can see all the pieces.
		- In poker, we can't see the opponent's cards and have to feel out the opponent's intentions.

## 2.3 Offensive and Defensive Processes and Capabilities
### Incident Lifecycle Overview
#### General Lifecycle
Not all-inclusive, but illustrates common teams, processes, and feedback loops
1. ==Monitoring and detecting==: defenders observe the network and connected systems to identify potential security security threats
2. ==Threat intelligence==: analysts gather information about potential and existing threats, inform other teams of the nature of the threats, and continually work to improve detection capabilities
3. ==Threat hunt==: investigators use threat intelligence to search for threats that may have evaded the initial detection process
4. ==Incident response==: once active threats are identified, response teams engage in an attempt to investigate and mitigate the event, minimize its impact, and restore normal operations
5. ==Digital forensics==: forensics teams may investigate and analyze the incident after it has occurred to better understand the scope, cause, and impact of the incident to help remediate and prevent future incidents.

*[NIST's CSF v2.0 Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) categorizes these defensive functions as part of a cycle to Govern, Identify, Prevent, Detect, Respond, and Recover*

#### Offensive Processes
1. ==Penetration test==:
	- a simulated attack of a system or network to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them
	- simulates the various phases and cycles of a typical malicious attacker including *recon*, *scanning*, *exploitation*, *persistence*, and *privilege escalation*
	- an offensive cybersecurity practitioner will also report vulnerabilities, list remediation steps, and often test again after remediation
2. ==Social engineering==:
	- an attacker (or cybersecurity practitioner) attempts to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security
	- might include phishing, pretexting, and baiting
	- goal is to identify vulnerabilities related to human behavior and organizational processes
