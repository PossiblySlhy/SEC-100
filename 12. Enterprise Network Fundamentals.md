## Understanding Enterprise Network Architecture
### Enterprises and Their Technology
An enterprise is defined as a for-profit business with ~250+ employees, comprising of individual business units (i.e. sales, HR, or engineering). The goal of an enterprise is to balance performance across business units to optimize overall enterprise performance.

Enterprises, regardless of their sector, typically operate standard systems covering business intel, customer relationships, finance, HR, and logistics. Some or all of these may be integrated into an *Enterprise Resource Planning* (ERP, e.g. SAP and Oracle).

Businesses may also operate sector-specific technologies including *operational systems*. For example, a telecom company will have its enterprise-wide systems as well as its operational carrier network. Or a manufacturing company may have its enterprise-wide systems together with the operation technologies that are used in the manufacturing processes.

Regardless of sector, most technology within an enterprise will be connected. In addition to all of the above, this includes video conferencing systems, building management systems, and other special-purpose technologies.

The points that can be accessed by an attacker to send data into or extract data out of an enterprise are known as the *attack surface*. The attack surface consists of web portals, APIs, application forms, and open services. To simplify, it's all of the potential points where an attacker might disrupt or gain unauthorized access to an asset in the org. An enterprise will have an internet-facing attack surface and an internal attack surface, which would be accessible once the attacker has managed to get inside the network.

As a defender, we need to be aware that we may have malicious contractors and employees on the internal network, with easy access to the internal attack surface.
