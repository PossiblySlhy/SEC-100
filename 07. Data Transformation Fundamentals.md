## Data Encoding Techniques
### Binary Encoding
- Allows the use of 1s and 0s to represent far more complex data
- Can convert from command line using `obase` or `ibase` and `bc`
    - `obase` > output base
        - ex. `obase = 2 ; 7 | bc >> 111`
        - Using base 2, converts the number 7 to 111
    - `ibase` > input base
        - ex. `ibase = 2 ; 111 | bc >> 7`
        - Using base 2, converts the number to decimal 7
- A single byte = 0b11111111 or 255 in decimal

### Hexadecimal Encoding
- 0 - F, notated by 0x1
- A single byte = 0xff
- Use `xxd` to output the hex-encoded representation of a file

### Base64 Encoding
Base64 allows us to transfer binary data over channels that can only represent text data (e.g. transferring a binary exe file electronically)
- Works by converting every 3 bytes of binary data into 4 Base64 characters
    - Each 3 byte sequence is known as a *block*
    - 3*8 bytes of input produces 4*6 Base64 bytes of output
        - If the input is not divisible by 6, add 0's at the end to pad it

## Hashing
### Basic Hashing
The main component of any hashing process is the *hashing algorithm* or *hash function*
- The hash output will process input data and produce an output hash
    - Length of the input doesn't matter, the hash will always be the same size
    - The same input data will **always** produce the same hash
- There are many different hashing algorithms (i.e. MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2)
- An ideal hash function satisfies 2 properties:
    - Fast to compute
    - Minimizes duplication of output values (i.e. collision)
        - MD5 is no longer recommended due to issues with collision and several types of attacks

### Checksums
Checksums are used to prove the integrity of transmitted data. If the checksums calculated on the sender's side are the same as the ones calculated after the data transmission, it means the data is intact and complete.
- Software providers often include the checksum along with software releases. This allows users to calculate the checksum of the downloaded file to verify it hasn't been modified in transit.

### Password Hashing
Password hashing is a process used to securely store passwords by convering them into a hash. When a user creates password, the hashing algorithm transforms it into a unique hash valute before storing it. Even if hackers obtained the hash, it would be difficult to retrieve the original password due to the one-way nature of hashing.
- On Linux, password hashes are stored in the `/etc/shadow` file in the format `$id$salt$hash`
    - $1 = MD5
    - $5 = SHA256
    - $6 = SHA512
- On Windows, hashes are stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM) file in the format "uid:rid:lm hash:ntlm hash"
    - LM and NTLM are two different hashing algorithms used by Windows. LM is now obsolete and disabled in newer versions of Windows. The LM hash in SAM now is always the hash for an empty string.

Despite the one-way nature of hashing, it is still possible to recover the original password given a specific hash.
- Brute force attacks or password cracking can be used by generating hashes for as many different passwords as possible
- Rainbow tables rely on using known hashes and checking to see if there is a pre-existing match inside the database

### Hash Salting
Hash salting involves prepending a random string to a password. Prepending the string will result in a different hash. Different strings can also be used for identical password to ensure there are no repeat hashes.

An additional layer can be used by peppering, which is just another random value that is often more protected than the salt.
