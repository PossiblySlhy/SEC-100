## Basic Navigation
``/`` *root directory*
``pwd`` *present working directory*
``cd <directory_name>`` *change directory*
``..`` *move up one dir*

## Listing Files
``ls`` *list files in pwd*
- ``ls -la`` *long list, includes all files including hidden files*
- ``ls -1`` *lists files line by line*

## Reading File Contents
``cat`` *reads file contents out to the terminal*
- ``cat -n`` *lists line numbers as well*
- ``cat <file_name> | less`` *displays once screen at a time for larger files*
``head`` *prints the top n number of lines from a file*
- ex: ``head -n 10 file.txt`` prints the first 10 lines of file.txt
- same goes for ``tail`` but starts from the last line

## SSH
domain names can be associated with IP addresses under the `/etc/hosts` file

``ssh <username>@<host name or IP address>``
- ex: ``ssh atlas@linux-basics`` will use atlas as the username and connect to the IP address associated with the host name listed in `/etc/hosts`

## Linux Filesystem (FHS)
**FHS**:  *Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**

### Top Level Directories
- `/bin/`: basic programs
- `/boot/`: Linux kernel and other files required for its early boot process
- `/dev/`: device files
- `/etc/`: configuration files
- `/home/`: user's personal files
- `/lib/`: basic libraries
- `/media/`: mount points for removable devices (CD/DVD-ROM, USB keys, etc.)
- `/mnt/` or `/mount/`: temporary mount point
- `/opt/`: extra applications provided by third parties
- `/root/`: administrator's (root's) personal files
- `/run/`: volatile runtime data that does not persist across reboots (not yet included in the FHS)
- `/sbin/`: system programs
- `/srv/`: data used by servers hosted on this system
- `/tmp/`: temporary files (this directory is often emptied at boot)
- `/usr/`: applications 
	- this directory is further subdivided into `bin`, `sbin`, `lib` according to the same logic as in the root directory
	- `/usr/share/` contains architecture-independent data 
	-  `/usr/local/` directory is meant to be used by the administrator for installing applications manually without overwriting files handled by the packaging system (dpkg)
- `/var/`: variable data handled by services, includes log files, queues, spools, and caches.
- `/proc/` and `/sys/` are specific to the Linux kernel (and not part of the FHS), used by the kernel for exporting data to user space

### Creating and Removing Files and Directories
- ``touch`` *creates a file with the specified name*
- ``rm`` *removes the specified file*
- ``mkdir`` *creates a new directory with the specified name*
- ``rmdir`` *removes an **empty** directory*
- ``rm -r`` *will remove non-empty directories*
- ``mv <file> <directory`` *will move files to the specified directory*
	- can also be used to rename files by using `mv` within the pwd
- ``cp <copied file> <copy of file>`` *creates a copy of the contents of a file into another file*

## Users, Groups, and Permissions
### User Account Details
The most commonly used authentication scheme uses `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files
- `/etc/passwd` contains information about user accounts and can be read by anyone
- fingerprints of passwords are stored in `/etc/shadow` and can only be accessed with sudo privileges

```kali-shell
root@linux02:~# cat /etc/passwd | grep john
john:x:1002:1002:John Doe,,,:/home/john:/bin/bash
```
*example of an /etc/passwd file*

In the above example:
- *john* is the username in plain text
- *x* indicates the password is stored in the *shadow* file
- the first *1002* indicated the user ID (**UID**), the second is primary group ID (**GID**)
	- a UID of 0 signifies the system admin super user, or *root*
- *John Doe* is a *comment field*, usually containing the full name of the user
- `/home/john` is the user's home directory
- `/bin/bash` is the default shell env for the user

```kali-shell
root@linux02:~# cat /etc/shadow | grep john
john:
$6$NI7mGcYMiuhDrmiB$2T0aiaOxj.jn3xrhAOe6ORobE2w8mEfbfJ3h0M2eKIBBFptCs3qzLnh21GrRjpAEG1mih2WxbXYhUfKFrjcRU0:18829:0:99999:7:::
```
*/etc/shadow example*

In the above example
- *john* is the username in plain text
- next piece, starting with $ is the encrypted password
- *18829* is the last time the password was changed, n days ago
- *0* is the minimum number of days required between password changes
- *99999* is the maximum number of days the password is valid for
- *7* is the number of days in advance the user will be warned to change their password

```kali-shell
root@linux02:~# cat /etc/group | grep sudo
sudo:x:27:cathy,bill,senji
```
*/etc/group file example*
