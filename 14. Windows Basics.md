## Windows Permissions
- **Windows New Technology File System** (*NTFS*)
    - Standard file system for Windows
    - Provides foundation for file storage and includes support for security features (i.e. file and folder perm's)
- **Discretionary Access Control Lists** (*DACLs*)
    - Lists that control/define perm's assigned to users and groups for any object (i.e. file or directory)
    - Each DACL is made up of **Access Control Entities** (*ACEs*), which specify access rights for a user/group on that object
    - Access rights such as *read* can be both granted and explicitly denied
        - Useful for denying a specific user the permission to read a file, still allowing other users in the same group read access
