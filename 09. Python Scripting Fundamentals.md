## Introduction to Python and Its Environment
### Automating a Solution
Logs are text files that contain execution events of an application or service and are instrumental in many fields of security.
- One common log format is the *access log* used by the Apache *httpd* web server
    - The access log contains information about each request that the server processes and some metadata about the responses it provides users. Each entry contains the following fields:
        - IP Address
        - Remote User Identifier (-, if empty)
        - UserID (-, if anonymous)
        - Date & Time
        - Request Line (HTTP method, requested resource, and HTTP version)
        - Status Code (i.e. 200 for successful, 404 for not found)
        - Content Size (measured in bytes)
        - Referrer (enclosed in quotes, shows the address of the previous web page where a link was followed to the current page)
        - User Agent (last field also enclosed in quotes, identifies the browser and OS of the user)
